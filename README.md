# autonomous_driver
This is a master thesis project dealing with the investigation of autonomous driving. For that purpose, a modular, mobile and open-source development environment was built and implemented on an auonomous model vehicle. This vehicle is part of the development environment, can be used as a development tool as well as for HIL-tests of software applications for autonomous driving.

This repository provides the Autonomous Driver software that implements an autonomous driving software system. It has a graphical user interface, an autonomous driving mode and a remote control mode. In the autonomous driving mode it detects the road lane based on white road markings and stop signs with a camera. With a ultrasonic sensor it detects obstacles.

The __alpha0__ version branch is the first iteration of this project and was developed as C and C++ hybrid code. _It will not be developed any further._ Checkout the latest more object-oriented version __master__ which is using _C++11_.
